•	The maximum weather for June is 85 F, and December is 83 F.
•	With little difference in weather during different times of the year, one can safely say an ice cream shop is maintainable year-round. 
# Summary:

With this slight change in weather throughout different times of the year, it is reasonable to state that an ice cream shop would be successful and maintainable throughout the year in Hawaii.
